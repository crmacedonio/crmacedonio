This project, a very small project, is very useful for testing and learning [*Lazarus IDE*](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) and your tools. 
The original version of this application (I called BrwScr) was developed in *Delphi 3*, just used to navigate 
between source files and other types of files in plain text. 
The application has no intention of being more than it is, just that. **Use and enjoy!**
